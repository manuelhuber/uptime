# V1.1
## Major:

- **!! Fixed long standing bug in the original Darktide HUD where it wouldn't always show all buffs !!**
    - This bug was also messing up the Uptime tracking. So if you noticed very low uptime values, e.g. for some
      keystones, this is now fixed.
- Added settings to show more columns (e.g. total uptime instead of only percentage)
- Added tooltips for weapon blessings
- Added mission timeline
- Fixed bug where some buffs wouldn't show correct stacks
- added Chinese locale

## Minor:

- Added custom handling for max stacks for some unique talents (e.g. Scrier's Gaze)
- Fixed bug order (sometimes they wouldn't be shown in correct descending order)
- Various minor style tweaks
