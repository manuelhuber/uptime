# V1.1

## Major:

- **!! Fixed long standing bug in the original Darktide HUD where it wouldn't always show all buffs !!**
    - This bug was also messing up the Uptime tracking. So if you noticed very low uptime values, e.g. for some
      keystones, this is now fixed.
- Added settings to show more columns (e.g. total uptime instead of only percentage)
- Fixed bug where some weapon blessings wouldn't show correct stacks
- Added tooltips for weapon blessings

## Minor:

- Added support for max stacks for Scrier's Gaze (both the initial and lingering buff)
- Fixed bug order (sometimes they wouldn't be shown in correct descending order)
- Various minor style tweaks
